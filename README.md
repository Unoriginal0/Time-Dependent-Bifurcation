# Time-dependent bifurcation in a dynamical system

This code accompanies the paper which analyses the mathematical model used when treating the topic of Arctic sea-ice in climate science. 

The purpose of the Python code is to find the steady state solutions to the ordinary differential equation which describes the Arctic sea-ice mathematically.

The Mathematica notebook analyses different ODE models and generates the figures for the paper.
